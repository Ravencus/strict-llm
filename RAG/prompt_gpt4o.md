In the uploaeded .jsonl file, each object contains an "informal_prefix" field and a "formal_statement" field. The "informal_prefix" field contains a natural language math statement, and the "formal_statement" field contains a LEAN code representation of that statement. Each () in the LEAN code represents one or a set of math concepts in the natural language statement. I want you to find the correspondence for each object in the .jsonl file, and output them into a .jsonl file.
An example is as follows:
object: 
{"name": "exercise_2_27a", "split": "valid", "informal_prefix": "/-- Suppose $E\\subset\\mathbb{R}^k$ is uncountable, and let $P$ be the set of condensation points of $E$. Prove that $P$ is perfect.-/\n", "formal_statement": "theorem exercise_2_27a (k : ℕ) (E P : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)))\n  (hE : E.Nonempty ∧ ¬ Set.Countable E)\n  (hP : P = {x | ∀ U ∈ 𝓝 x, ¬ Set.Countable (P ∩ E)}) :\n  IsClosed P ∧ P = {x | ClusterPt x (𝓟 P)} :=", "goal": "k : ℕ\nE P : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k))\nhE : E.Nonempty ∧ ¬E.Countable\nhP : P = {x | ∀ U ∈ 𝓝 x, ¬(P ∩ E).Countable}\n⊢ IsClosed P ∧ P = {x | ClusterPt x (𝓟 P)}", "header": "import Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n"}
example output object:
{"name": "exercise_2_27a", "pairs": [("$E\\subset\\mathbb{R}^k$", "(E P : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)))"),("uncountable", "(hE : E.Nonempty ∧ ¬ Set.Countable E)"),("let $P$ be the set of condensation points of $E$","(hP : P = {x | ∀ U ∈ 𝓝 x, ¬ Set.Countable (P ∩ E)})"),("Prove that $P$ is perfect","IsClosed P ∧ P = {x | ClusterPt x (𝓟 P)}")]}
