\section{PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS}

Here, as in Sec. 9.16, $\{e_1, \ldots, e_n\}$ and $\{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$ are the standard bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$.

\textbf{Proof} Fix $j$. Since $f$ is differentiable at $x$,

\[
f(x + te_j) - f(x) = f'(x)(te_j) + r(te_j)
\]

where $\lvert r(te_j)\rvert/t \to 0$ as $t \to 0$. The linearity of $f'(x)$ shows therefore that

\begin{equation}
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(x + te_j) - f(x)}{t} = f'(x)e_j.
\end{equation}

If we now represent $f$ in terms of its components, as in (24), then (28) becomes

\begin{equation}
\lim_{t \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{f(x + te_j) - f(x)}{t} = u_j = f'(x)e_j.
\end{equation}

It follows that each quotient in this sum has a limit, as $t \to 0$ (see Theorem 4.10), so that each $(D_j f)(x)$ exists, and then (27) follows from (29).

Here are some consequences of Theorem 9.17: Let $f'(x')$ be the matrix that represents $f'(x)$ with respect to our standard bases, as in Sec. 9.9.

Then $f'(x)e_j$ is the $j$th column vector of $[f'(x)]$, and (27) shows therefore that the number $(D_j f)(x)$ occupies the spot in the $r$th row and $j$th column of $[f'(x)]$. Thus

\[
[f'(x)] = \begin{bmatrix}
(D_1 f)(x) & \cdots & (D_n f)(x) \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
(D_1 f_m)(x) & \cdots & (D_m f_n)(x)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

If $h = \sum_{j=1}^n h_j e_j$ is any vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then (27) implies that

\begin{equation}
f'(xh) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\sum_{j=1}^m (D_j f)(x)h_j\right) u_j.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Example 9.18} Let $\gamma$ be a differentiable mapping of the segment $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}^1$ into an open set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, in other words, $\gamma$ is a differentiable curve in $E$. Let $f$ be a real-valued differentiable function with domain $E$. Thus $f$ is a differentiable mapping of $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^1$. Define

\begin{equation}
g(t) = f(\gamma(t)) \quad (a < t < b).
\end{equation}

The chain rule asserts then that

\begin{equation}
g'(t) = f'(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t) \quad (a < t < b).
\end{equation}
