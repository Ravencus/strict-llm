\section*{THE REAL AND COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEMS}

\noindent
Proof (a), (b), and (c) are obvious, and (d) is an immediate consequence of the Schwarz inequality. By (d) we have
\[
|x + y|^2 = (x + y) \cdot (x + y) = x \cdot x + 2x \cdot y + y \cdot y
\]
\[
\leq |x|^2 + 2|x||y| + |y|^2 = (|x| + |y|)^2,
\]
so that (e) is proved. Finally, (f) follows from (e) if we replace \( x \) by \( x - y \) and \( y \) by \( y - z \).

\subsection*{Remarks}
Theorem 1.37 (a), (b), and (f) will allow us (see Chap. 2) to regard \( \mathbb{R}^4 \) as a metric space. 

\noindent
\( \mathbb{R}^1 \) (the set of all real numbers) is usually called the line, or the real line. Likewise, \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) is called the plane, or the complex plane (compare Definitions 1.24 and 1.36). In these two cases the norm is just the absolute value of the corresponding real or complex number.

\section*{APPENDIX}
Theorem 1.19 will be proved in this appendix by constructing \( R \) from \( Q \). We shall divide the construction into several steps.

\subsection*{Step 1}
The members of \( R \) will be certain subsets of \( Q \), called cuts. A cut is, by definition, any set \( \alpha \subset Q \) with the following three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(I)] \( \alpha \) is not empty, and \( \alpha \neq \emptyset \).
    \item[(II)] If \( p \in \alpha, q \in Q, \) and \( q < p\), then \( q \in \alpha \).
    \item[(III)] If \( p \in \alpha, \) then \( p < r < \alpha \) for some \( r \in \alpha \).
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The letters \( p, q, r, \ldots \) will always denote rational numbers, and \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots \) will denote cuts.

\noindent
Note that (III) simply says that \( \alpha \) has no largest member; (II) implies two facts which will be used freely:
\begin{quote}
If \( p \in \alpha \) and \( q \notin \alpha \) then \( p < q \).\\
If \( r \in \alpha \) and \( r < s \) then \( s \notin \alpha \).
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Step 2}
Define “\( \alpha < \beta \)” to mean: \( \alpha \) is a proper subset of \( \beta \). Let us check that this meets the requirements of Definition 1.5. If \( \alpha < \beta \) and \( \beta < \gamma \) it is clear that \( \alpha < \gamma \). (A proper subset of a proper subset is a proper subset.) It is also clear that at most one of the three relations holds:
\[
\alpha < \beta, \quad \alpha = \beta, \quad \beta < \alpha.
\]
